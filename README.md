# Text-Classification-ML
Python notebooks for text classification tasks through Machine Learning Techniques

this research aims to categorize the requirements presented by the client with different supervised ML
techniques to obtain the category belonging to the submitted request in an automatic way, provide the
protocols that give a solution in a more precise way, and with a reduced response time.

Eight ML techniques for text classification were applied to the dataset, and the performance of each of them was evaluated. 
From these results, the three techniques with the best performance in the percentage of the accuracy
metric were selected, which were: Logistic Regression Classifier (LR) with 77,58%,
Random Forest Classifier (RF) with 77,10% and Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVM) with 76,68%. 

Cross Validation Techniques and Auto-MachineLearning through Sk-Learn was also evaluated to the dataset.
